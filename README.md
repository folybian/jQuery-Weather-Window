# jQuery-Weather-Window
A small project (made with jQuery, JS and HTML/CSS), where you can choose diferent climate conditions either manually or let them mix randomly. You can also change the frame-layout of the window. (Both features can be achieved by just clicking on the city/weather or the frame)
